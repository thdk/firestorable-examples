## Example apps using [firestorable](https://github.com/thdk/firestorable)

The main goal of this repo is to demonstrate the use of [firestorable](https://github.com/thdk/firestorable) by providing **example applications** that use firestorable with react and mobx.

Have a look at the first examples:

* [Timesheet app](timesheets)
* [Scrum poker online multiplayer](scrum-poker-cards)

Let me know if you have a suggestion for another example application.
